# Wallet Functionality Fixes

This document provides an overview of the fixes applied to the wallet functionality in the application.

## Issues Addressed

1. **Table Name Issue**: The wallet service was trying to query a table called 'transactions' instead of 'wallet_transactions'.
2. **Missing Deposit Function**: The wallet service was trying to call a function called `process_wallet_deposit` that didn't exist in the database.
3. **Missing Withdrawal Functions**: The wallet service was trying to call functions called `request_withdrawal` and `approve_withdrawal` that didn't exist in the database.
4. **Pagination Error**: When there were no transactions in the wallet_transactions table, the pagination was trying to access rows that don't exist.

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Table Name Fix

- Updated all references from 'transactions' to 'wallet_transactions' in the wallet-service.ts file
- Updated the foreign key reference from 'transactions_related_listing_id_fkey' to 'wallet_transactions_related_listing_id_fkey'

### 2. Deposit Function

Created a new migration script `migration_add_wallet_deposit_function.sql` that:
- Creates a `process_wallet_deposit` function that uses the existing `update_wallet_balance` function to process deposits
- Grants the necessary permissions for authenticated users to execute the function

### 3. Withdrawal Functions

Created a new migration script `migration_add_wallet_withdrawal_function.sql` that:
- Creates the `withdrawal_requests` table if it doesn't exist
- Creates a `request_withdrawal` function that validates the withdrawal request and creates a record in the withdrawal_requests table
- Creates an `approve_withdrawal` function that approves a withdrawal request and updates the wallet balance
- Grants the necessary permissions for authenticated users to execute these functions

### 4. Pagination Fix

Updated the `getTransactions` method in the wallet-service.ts file to:
- Check if there are any transactions before attempting to query with a range
- Add proper handling for the case where there are no transactions
- Add a null check for the count variable

## How to Apply

1. Update the wallet-service.ts file with the changes described above
2. Run the migration scripts against your Supabase database:

```bash
psql -h your-supabase-host -d postgres -U postgres -f migration_fix_wallet_issue.sql
psql -h your-supabase-host -d postgres -U postgres -f migration_add_wallet_deposit_function.sql
psql -h your-supabase-host -d postgres -U postgres -f migration_add_wallet_withdrawal_function.sql
```

Or copy and paste the SQL commands into the Supabase SQL Editor.

## Verification

After applying these fixes, the wallet functionality should work correctly. Users should be able to:

1. View their wallet balance
2. Add funds to their wallet
3. Request withdrawals from their wallet
4. See their transaction history
5. Navigate to the "View All" transactions page

If you still encounter issues after applying these fixes, check the Supabase logs for more details.
